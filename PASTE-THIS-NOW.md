## 📊 Watch For:

**Good Signs:**
- ✅ "Reading TEST-GENERATION-WORKFLOW.md"
- ✅ "Creating tests/api/test_api_endpoints.py"
- ✅ "Running pytest..."
- ✅ "Phase 1 complete, proceeding to Phase 2"

**Bad Signs:**
- ❌ "Let me explain what I would do..."
- ❌ "Here's how you could approach this..."
- ❌ Making up fake Python code
- ❌ Asking for confirmation
